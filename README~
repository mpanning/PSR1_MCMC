v 0.0
Adaptation of transdimensional Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm from 
Stephanie James for use in simultaneous determination of source parameters and 
average 1D structure with recordings of P and S waves and group arrivals of R1

Will run now and produce chains and plot saved models, error, and acceptance 
rate, and histograms of number of layers and hyperparameter values.  

In order to run the model, go into the src/sw_python subdirectory and enter:

make all

Then make a clean run directory, and copy the following files

from src/sw_python:
rayleigh_python.so

from src/MCMC:
MCMC_main.py
MCMC_functions.py

from src/sample_data:
bwtimes.dat
gtimes.dat
premiso_no_2000km_bwtimes
premiso_no_2000km_gtimes
premiso_no_4000km_bwtimes
premiso_no_4000km_gtimes

You need to edit MCMC_main.py to set the variable MAIN to this run directory.

You can then launch the program by entering

python MCMC_main.py

from the run directory
